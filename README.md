### Introduction
This project was a 4 week long blue ocean where our team completed an app to track the transition timeline for out-processing soldiers
This app is made to assist our client in his job. 

### Technologies
- React version 17.0.2
- React Router Dom version 6.1.1
- Bootstrap version 5.1.3
- Jest version 5.16.1
- Firebase version 9.6.1
- Material UI version 5.2.5

### Research
The research for this project consisted of exploring methods of implementing an accruate transition task list, 
customizing components provided by Material UI, and establishing authentication using Firebase.

### Structure
In this application, a client with admin privledges is able to view and control tasks' associated with a service member (client without admin privledges).
The admin controls these tasks through an admin dashboard, which is separate from the base user page. All of the tasks are categorized by the period of time 
until the service members transition date from military service.

### Acknowledgment
We had an amazing workflow with daily stand ups, paired programming, and some individual component coding. We learned how to work together on a team 
like we will be doing in full time jobs. Below is a link to our trello board that we used daily to manage tickets, blocks, and code that needed reviewing.

### Reflection
We would have liked to implement a forgot password option on the initial log in but decided to focus on more time with the functionality of the student user page.
